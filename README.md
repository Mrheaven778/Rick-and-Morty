# Svelte + TS + Vite
It is a website where we make a request to https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character and display the name and images of the characters from the television series Rick and Morty. The technologies used are Svelte and Tailwind CSS
To begin with, we will use
```
npm i
``` 
to install the packages, and then 
to run it.
```
npm run dev
```
